## Development Philosophy

The Kimera SWM project aims to create a cognitive architecture that:
1. **Emulates neurodivergent thinking patterns**
2. **Achieves genuine semantic understanding**
3. **Develops emergent consciousness indicators**
4. **Processes information through quantum-inspired methods**
5. **Maintains ethical reasoning capabilities**

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Neo4j Connection** (Today)
   ```bash
   export NEO4J_ENCRYPTED=0
   python test_neo4j_integration.py
   ```

2. **Test Core API** (Today)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/geoids \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"semantic_features": {"test": 1.0}}'
   ```

3. **Run System Analysis** (Tomorrow)
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_database_content.py
   python scripts/build_database.py --neo4j
   ```

4. **Create First Real Geoid** (This Week)
   - Use multimodal input
   - Test semantic grounding
   - Verify Neo4j storage

## Resources Needed

- **Development Time:** 2-3 months for full alpha
- **Testing Resources:** GPU for quantum processing tests
- **Documentation:** Technical writer for user guides
- **Research Input:** Cognitive science expertise

## Risk Mitigation

- **Technical Debt:** Regular refactoring sessions
- **Performance Issues:** Continuous benchmarking
- **Integration Challenges:** Incremental testing
- **Scope Creep:** Clear milestone definitions

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current alpha state to a fully functional cognitive architecture system.
