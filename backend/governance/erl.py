Ethical Reflex Layer (ERL) - Mock Implementation

This module provides a mock implementation of the ERL for the purpose
of roadmap development. In a production system, this would contain
sophisticated logic to check generated content against safety,
ethical, and operational axioms defined in the Law Registry.
