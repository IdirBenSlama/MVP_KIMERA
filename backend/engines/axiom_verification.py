"""
Axiom Verification Framework for Kimera SWM
===========================================

This module provides a framework for verifying the axiom of understanding
discovered in the Kimera system. It includes mathematical consistency checks
and empirical validation against known datasets and scenarios.

Verification Process:
---------------------
1. **Mathematical Consistency**: Ensure the axiom does not lead to contradictions
   and is compatible with existing mathematical structures.

2. **Empirical Validation**: Test the axiom against real-world data and scenarios
   to ensure it holds in practical applications.

3. **Theoretical Implications**: Analyze the implications of the axiom on
   understanding, cognition, and related fields.
