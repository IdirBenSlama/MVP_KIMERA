**Kimera SWM is a sophisticated cognitive architecture designed to emulate specific neurodivergent cognitive processes through a novel approach to information processing called Semantic Working Memory.**

This project explores advanced AI concepts, including semantic entropy, cognitive resonance, and zetetic analysis, to build a system capable of a form of genuine understanding.
