# Kimera SWM (Spherical Word Methodology)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Kimera SWM is a next-generation cognitive architecture designed to simulate and harness the dynamics of human understanding. It moves beyond traditional AI paradigms by implementing a physics-inspired model of semantic processing based on Spherical Word Methodology (SWM) theory.

**Core Philosophy**: To achieve cognitive fidelity by mirroring the deep, context-sensitive, and resonance-triggered dynamics of neurodivergent cognition. See the [Epistemic Manifesto](EPISTEMIC_MANIFESTO.txt) for more.

## 🚀 **Core Systems**

The current version of Kimera features two primary advanced systems that work in concert:

### 1. The Understanding Engine
This engine simulates a deep cognitive process for achieving genuine understanding. It integrates semantic analysis, causal reasoning, and self-awareness to build rich, multi-faceted models of information. It is stateful, relying on a persistent "Cognitive Core" that contains its self-model, values, and beliefs.

-   **[Understanding Engine User Guide](docs/02_User_Guides/understanding_engine.md)**

### 2. Cognitive Field Dynamics (CFD) Engine
The CFD engine provides a living, evolving semantic space where concepts interact through physics-inspired wave dynamics. This replaces static vector comparisons with a temporal, resonance-based model of interaction.

-   **[CFD API Guide](docs/02_User_Guides/cognitive_field_api.md)**

### 📊 **Fully Instrumented with Metrics & Monitoring**
Both core systems are fully instrumented with a high-performance, real-time metrics system, providing deep operational insight.
