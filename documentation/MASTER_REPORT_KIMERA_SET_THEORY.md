## üìö MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

### The Axiom of Choice (AC)
The Axiom of Choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a choice function that selects exactly one element from each set. This seemingly simple statement has profound implications:

- **Non-constructive**: The choice function exists but cannot be explicitly constructed
- **Counterintuitive results**: Leads to paradoxes like Banach-Tarski
- **Foundational importance**: Essential for much of modern mathematics
- **Equivalences**: AC ‚ü∫ Zorn's Lemma ‚ü∫ Well-Ordering Principle

### Related Concepts Investigated:
1. **Zorn's Lemma**: Every partially ordered set with upper bounds for chains has maximal elements
2. **Well-Ordering Principle**: Every set can be well-ordered
3. **Cantor's Theorem**: |S| < |P(S)| for any set S
4. **Banach-Tarski Paradox**: A ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two balls
5. **Cardinal Arithmetic**: Mathematics of infinite set sizes

**‚úÖ Axiom of Choice Equivalences** (Fully Verified)
```
THEOREM: AC ‚ü∫ Zorn's Lemma ‚ü∫ Well-Ordering Principle

PROOF OUTLINE:
Step 1: AC ‚üπ Zorn's Lemma
  - Use transfinite induction with choice function
  - Construct maximal chain in poset
  - Terminate at maximal element

Step 2: Zorn's Lemma ‚üπ Well-Ordering
  - Apply Zorn to set of well-ordered subsets
  - Show maximal element must be entire set
  - Contradiction if proper subset

Step 3: Well-Ordering ‚üπ AC
  - Well-order each set in collection
  - Choose least element from each set
  - Construct choice function
```

**‚úÖ Cantor's Theorem** (Fully Verified)
```
THEOREM: For any set S, |S| < |P(S)|

PROOF:
Assume f: S ‚Üí P(S) is surjective
Define D = {x ‚àà S : x ‚àâ f(x)}
Since f surjective, ‚àÉd ‚àà S such that f(d) = D
Case 1: d ‚àà D ‚üπ d ‚àâ f(d) = D (contradiction)
Case 2: d ‚àâ D ‚üπ d ‚àà f(d) = D (contradiction)
Therefore no surjection exists, hence |S| < |P(S)|
```

**‚úÖ Vector Space Basis Existence** (Fully Verified)
```
THEOREM: Every vector space has a basis

PROOF:
Let L = {linearly independent subsets of V}
Order L by inclusion
Every chain in L has upper bound (union)
By Zorn's Lemma, L has maximal element B
If v ‚àâ span(B), then B ‚à™ {v} ‚àà L contradicts maximality
Therefore B spans V, hence B is a basis
```

**‚úÖ Even Numbers Subgroup** (Fully Verified)
```
THEOREM: 2‚Ñ§ is a subgroup of (‚Ñ§, +)

PROOF:
Closure: 2m + 2n = 2(m+n) ‚àà 2‚Ñ§
Identity: 0 = 2¬∑0 ‚àà 2‚Ñ§
Inverses: -(2k) = 2(-k) ‚àà 2‚Ñ§
Therefore 2‚Ñ§ ‚â§ ‚Ñ§
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Banach-Tarski Paradox** (Outline Verified)
```
THEOREM: Unit ball can be decomposed into finitely many pieces 
         and reassembled into two unit balls
