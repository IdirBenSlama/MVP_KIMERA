        The Axiom of Choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets,
        there exists a choice function that selects exactly one element from
        each set. This seemingly simple statement has profound implications
        for mathematics and leads to counterintuitive results.

        Zorn's Lemma states that every partially ordered set in which every
        chain has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.
        It's equivalent to the Axiom of Choice and is often used in algebra

        The Well-Ordering Principle states that every set can be well-ordered,

        The Banach-Tarski Paradox shows that a solid ball can be decomposed

        Cardinal arithmetic deals with the arithmetic of infinite sets.
