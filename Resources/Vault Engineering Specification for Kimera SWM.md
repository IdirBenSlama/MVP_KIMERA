2. Data Structures & Schemas
2.1 Scar Schema
Each Scar is stored as a node with the following JSON structure:
{
"scarID": "SCAR_456", // string, unique identifier
"geoids": ["GEOID_123", "GEOID_789"], // array of strings
"reason": "Conflict: pref_color blue vs red", // string
"timestamp": "2025-05-27T12:05:00Z", // xsd:dateTime
"resolvedBy": "consensus_module", // string
"pre_entropy": 0.67, // float
"post_entropy": 0.82, // float
"delta_entropy": 0.15, // float
"cls_angle": 45.0, // float, collapse line shape angle in degrees
"semantic_polarity": 0.2, // float [-1.0, 1.0], sign-based polarity
"originVault": "A", // "A" or "B"
"expression": { /* feature vector or JSON map */ }
}
● scarID: Unique Scar identifier.
● geoids: IDs of Geoids involved.
● reason: Text description.
● timestamp: ISO 8601.
● resolvedBy: Module or process name that resolved any conflict.
● pre_entropy, post_entropy, delta_entropy: Semantic entropy metrics.
● cls_angle: Collapse Line Shape torsion angle (degrees).
● semantic_polarity: Scalar polarity value.
● originVault: Indicates initial vault (A or B).
● expression: Detailed feature representation.
2.2 Vault Metadata
Each vault maintains counters and metrics, stored in a metadata document:
{
"vaultID": "Vault-A", // "Vault-A" or "Vault-B"
"totalScars": 10234, // integer
"activeScars": 2876, // integer
"entropySum": 1523.8, // float, sum of semantic entropy of active Scars
"avg_cls_angle": 47.2, // float, average CLS angle
"incomingLoadLastCycle": 125, // integer
"outgoingLoadLastCycle": 118, // integer
"frictionMetric": 0.34 // float [0.0, 1.0], averaged MFG
}
3. Vault Topology
3.1 Dual Vault Activation
Upon system startup, instantiate two vaults:
vaultA = Vault(id="Vault-A")
vaultB = Vault(id="Vault-B")
Both vaults register with a Vault Manager responsible for routing incoming Scars.
3.2 Partitioning Criteria
When a new Scar s arrives, compute routing decision based on:
1. Mutation Frequency (MF):
○ If s.mutationFrequency > MF_threshold_high, route to Vault-A; else
route to Vault-B.
○ MF_threshold_high = 0.75 (normalized frequency).
2. Semantic Polarity (SP):
○ If abs(s.semantic_polarity) > 0.5, route to vault determined by sign:
positive → Vault-A; negative → Vault-B.
7. Vault Optimization & Memory Management
7.1 Optimization Triggers
Initiate optimization when any of the following are true:
Metric Threshold
Drift Lineage Depth > 12 for ≥ 10% of active Scars
Scar Density > 25 new Scars per 100 cycles
Vault Entropy Slope > 0.05 increase over last 500 cycles
Identity Thread Saturation > 85% overlap among active Scar
groups
Loop Memory Pressure > 90% of symbolic storage capacity
def should_optimize(vault):
cond1 = vault.max_drift_depth > 12 and vault.percent_drifts_high > 0.10
cond2 = vault.newScarsLast100 > 25
cond3 = vault.entropySlope > 0.05
cond4 = vault.threadOverlapPercent > 0.85
cond5 = vault.memoryUsagePercent > 0.90
return any([cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5])
7.2 Optimization Operations
7.2.1 Drift Collapse Pruning
Remove Scars with:
● drift_depth > 12
● loop_active = False
● goal_impact = 0
def prune_drift_clusters(vault):
candidates = [
s for s in vault.activeScars_list
if s.drift_depth > 12 and not s.loop_active and s.goal_impact == 0
]
for s in candidates:
vault.remove(s)
log_pruned_scar(s.scarID, current_cycle)
7.2.2 Composite Compaction
Identify low-entropy clusters (entropy < 0.43) with cluster_size < 5 and merge into
latent patterns.
def composite_compaction(vault):
clusters = vault.get_clusters() # returns lists of related scars
for cluster in clusters:
if average_entropy(cluster) < 0.43 and len(cluster) < 5:
lp = create_latent_pattern(cluster)
for s in cluster:
vault.remove(s)
vault.insert(lp)
log_compaction(cluster, lp.latentID, current_cycle)
7.2.3 Vault Reindexing
def reindex_vault(vault):
# Rebuild graph indices:
vault.graph_db.rebuild_index("scarID")
vault.graph_db.rebuild_index("cls_angle")
vault.graph_db.rebuild_index("timestamp")
7.2.4 Influence-Based Retention Scoring
Compute for each Scar:
\text{IRS} = \frac{\text{loop_influence} \times \text{goal_contribution} \times
\text{anchor_coupling}}{\text{entropy_decay}}
mutated = s.mutate()
self.insert(mutated)
self.entropySum += semantic_entropy(mutated.expression)
● Mutates Scars with contradiction_score > 80 and adds to entropySum.
8.3 Reactor Vault
class ReactorVault(Vault):
def reactor_cycle(self):
scars = self.activeScars_list
for i, s1 in enumerate(scars):
for s2 in scars[i+1:]:
if semantic_overlap(s1.expression, s2.expression) > 0.7:
combined = combine_features(s1.expression, s2.expression)
new_scar = Scar(
scarID=f"RCV_{s1.scarID}_{s2.scarID}",
geoids=list(set(s1.geoids + s2.geoids)),
timestamp=current_cycle_time(),
expression=combined,
cls_angle=recompute_cls(combined),
semantic_polarity=(s1.semantic_polarity + s2.semantic_polarity)/2
)
self.insert(new_scar)
● Recombines overlapping Scars (overlap > 0.7) into a new Scar.
8.4 Compression Vault
class CompressionVault(Vault):
def compress_cycle(self):
if self.entropySum > 5.0:
victim = random.choice(self.activeScars_list)
compress_expression(victim.expression)
self.entropySum *= 0.5
● When entropySum > 5.0, compress a random Scar’s expression and halve
entropySum.
9. Integration Points
● SPDE (Semantic Pressure Diffusion Engine):
○ Consumes vault’s entropySum to adjust diffusion maps.
○ Produces sketch Geoids under pressure peaks; these enter vaults as
provisional Scars.
● MSCE (Memory/Scar Compression Engine):
○ Coordinates with vault pruning and compaction.
○ Merges residual Scars from eliminated Geoids.
● ZPA (Zetetic Prompt API):
○ Receives high-volatility Scars for potential user queries.
○ Flags ethical‐review Scars when delta_entropy > 1.0.
● SSL (Semantic Suspension Layer):
○ Quarantines Scars with IDI > 0.80.
○ Logs suspension events to vault audit.
