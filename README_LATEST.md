# KIMERA SWM â€“ Unified README (Reference Stub)

> **Single Source of Truth:** The canonical project documentation is now the root [`README.md`](README.md).  
> This stub exists only for backward-compatibility with previous links/reports.

Please consult the root **README.md** for:

- Quick-start installation (Python, GPU, **Neo4j**)
- Architecture overview (SQL + Graph dual-storage)
- API usage & endpoints
- Stress-testing & Neo4j integration tests
- Comprehensive documentation index & roadmap

All other legacy READMEs are deprecated and will be removed in a future cleanup cycle.
