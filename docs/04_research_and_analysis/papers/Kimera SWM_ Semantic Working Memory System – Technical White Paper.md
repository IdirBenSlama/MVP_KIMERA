doesn’t exceed this capacity by pruning as needed. This can be viewed as maintaining a constant “entropy
load” – if new events come in, some old low-value entropy must go out, similar to how an organism
maintains homeostasis by shedding excess heat or waste. We might even tie this to Landauer’s principle
conceptually: each bit erased frees some energy (which might be negligible physically per bit, but
conceptually it’s an accounting of resources). So the system might track how many bits it has erased and
how that relates to computational effort. In an engineering sense, this is just an accounting mechanism to
ensure we don’t overload memory; it encourages efficient encoding (so that the “energy” spent on memory
is used for valuable info only).
Practical Pruning Algorithms: We can outline a concrete pruning algorithm in Kimera SWM: 1. Calculate
Scores: Periodically (or when memory is at capacity), calculate an entropy score for each event or for each
candidate group of events. Also compute a reference count or influence score (how many other events
depend on this). 2. Rank Candidates: Create a list of events that are lowest in entropy contribution and low
in influence (no critical links). Events that are old and never accessed in a long time get a further push up
this list. 3. Apply Threshold: Determine a threshold such that removing candidates above it will free
enough space or reduce entropy by a target amount. This threshold could be adaptive – e.g., prune until
total memory entropy is under a desired value, or memory size under X MB. 4. Preservation Check: Before
removal, double-check constraints. For each candidate, simulate removal and see if it would increase the
entropy of any remaining memory item beyond acceptable levels (like if it was masking a contradiction or
providing a needed clue). This simulation can be simplified by our influence map or by recalculating mutual
information without that event. If removal is safe, proceed; if not, skip the event (it might be fundamentally
required). 5. Compress or Remove: For each approved candidate, decide whether to compress or
completely remove. Important but repetitive events might be replaced with a summary scar (so not full
removal). Trivial redundant ones can be removed entirely. If removed, and if an archive is maintained, move
it to long-term archive with a tombstone record. 6. Re-index/Update: After pruning, update indexes, and
also update entropy fields of related events because removing data can slightly increase uncertainty in
others (though we aimed to minimize that). The contradiction engine might also be notified to re-evaluate
consistency if, say, an event that contradicted another was removed (perhaps resolving a contradiction by
elimination).
This algorithm ensures no external dependency because all it needs are internal data and computations on
them. It’s effectively an in-memory garbage collector for knowledge, but guided by information content
rather than just reference count.
NEPENTHE and MIPP Inspirations in Action: To explicitly draw parallels: - Our method of removing low-
entropy events is just like NEPENTHE’s removal of low-entropy layers . In a DNN, those layers were
“linearizable” (not adding complexity) , so they could go. In memory, if a set of events doesn’t add
complexity to what the agent knows, they can go. - Our mutual information check mirrors MIPP’s focus on
retaining information flow . Just as MIPP ensures the pruned network can be retrained or still function
by keeping info flow, we ensure the memory can still answer queries and maintain narrative coherence
after pruning. - We also include what could be called “energy-aware pruning” – recognizing that pruning
should also optimize computational energy (less memory = less data to search through, faster responses,
maybe lower power for embedded devices). In practice, this means if two pruning options drop the same
bits but one saves more CPU cycles (like removing many small events vs one big one), we might choose the
path that yields computational efficiency. This aligns with thermodynamic optimization – akin to releasing
heat in the easiest way possible.

needed. - Use caching: if a certain query repeats (like the agent repeatedly asking “when did I last charge
battery?”), caching that answer or the relevant event speeds up subsequent recall.
Integration with Contradiction Engine: The contradiction engine’s output also influences access. If an
event is marked disputed, the access module might by default not surface it unless specifically asked, or it
might annotate it as “(controversial)” in responses. This ensures that what is retrieved and used by the
agent doesn’t blindly include bad data. Conversely, if two conflicting memories exist, a query might retrieve
both but the system will present or use them in a careful way (perhaps triggering a contradiction resolution
process before acting on them).
Real-World Usage Example: Suppose the agent is a personal assistant AI with Kimera SWM, and the user
asks: “Do I have any meetings related to Project X soon?” The query is parsed into semantic form: (user=Self,
action=meeting, topic=Project X, time=future?). The memory access will find all events that are meetings
about Project X. Because events are stored with topics and times, it fetches those events (maybe ones
where a meeting was scheduled). It finds one such event, a scheduled meeting next week. It also checks if
any contradictions: maybe two meetings double-booked? If yes, the contradiction engine flags it, and the
system might respond with an alert. If not, it simply answers based on the memory. Notice no single token
“meeting” needed to match, it could work even if the event was recorded as “Call with John regarding
Project X” – because the structured topic is Project X and type is meeting/call.
By designing memory access in this semantic-first way, we ensure flexibility (robust to wording), precision
(targeted by context), and recall (able to find relevant knowledge widely). Importantly, it’s all
“implementation-ready”: building an index on structured data and writing query handlers is straightforward
engineering, and avoids reliance on large external search services.
To tie this back to engineering realism: These patterns can be implemented with standard data structures
(hash tables, inverted indexes, etc.). They do not require exotic hardware or theoretical oracles. They are
analogous to how a well-designed database or knowledge base operates, but tailored to the semantic
memory use-case. Many cognitive architectures and databases already support similar queries; we are
simply ensuring to incorporate them in a way that leverages our event structure and entropy annotations.
Having covered storage, pruning, consistency, and retrieval, we now move to practical aspects of
implementing Kimera SWM, discussing data structures, code considerations and computational overhead to
demonstrate feasibility.
Implementation Guidelines
Designing the Kimera SWM concept is only half the battle; implementing it in code with efficiency and clarity
is the other half. In this section, we provide guidelines for how one might implement the system, covering
data structures, code-level patterns, and computational complexity. The goal is to show that each part of
the design can be realized with today’s engineering tools and to flag potential performance issues and how
to mitigate them.
Event Representation Data Structure: At the code level, each scar (event) can be represented as a
structured object or record. In an object-oriented language, this could be a class Event with fields
corresponding to the EchoForm grammar: e.g., actors , action , objects , timestamp , location ,
15
Parallelism and Concurrency: In a multi-threaded or distributed scenario, care must be taken with
memory modifications. We likely treat the memory store as a critical section (or use concurrent data
structures). For realism, we should mention that if the AI agent has multiple processes (or threads) reading/
writing memory, we need locking or atomic operations to avoid race conditions (e.g., two threads pruning
or adding simultaneously). A simple approach is to funnel all memory writes through a single thread or
queue (serializing modifications), while reads can be mostly concurrent if using immutable snapshots or
locks. This is an engineering choice depending on required performance. Given edge-AI context, often a
single agent might not need heavy multithreading for memory, but it's a consideration.
Language/Platform Considerations: The implementation can be language-agnostic, but each has trade-
offs: - In Python, ease of development is high, and it’s suitable if memory sizes are not huge (or if using
something like PyPy or C extensions for heavy parts). - In C++ or Rust, one can optimize memory usage
better and possibly handle larger scale, at cost of development complexity. - For an embedded device (edge
AI), C/C++ might be necessary, or even storing memory in a small SQLite database might be a pragmatic
choice (though that introduces an external component, but maybe acceptable as it’s just an embedded
library). - If persistence is needed across reboots, some lightweight file storage (JSON/CSV logs, or a binary
dump of the structures) can be implemented. Realistically, the system would have a routine to snapshot
memory to disk and load it on startup.
Code-Level Example: As an illustrative snippet, consider how to handle adding a new event and triggering
possible recall:
def add_event(event):
memory_store[event["id"]] = event
for field, index in indices.items():
val = event.get(field)
if val is None: continue
index.setdefault(val, []).append(event["id"])
update_entropy_stats(event, addition=True)
# Check contradictions with related events (e.g., same actors or objects)
related_ids = set()
for key in ["actors","object","location"]:
if event.get(key):
related_ids |= set(indices[key].get(event[key], []))
for rid in related_ids:
if rid == event["id"]: continue
check_contradiction(event, memory_store[rid])
# Trigger recall if needed
recall_candidates = retrieve_related_events(event)
for past_event in recall_candidates:
# perhaps merge past context with current or alert another module
handle_recalled_memory(past_event, event)
This pseudo-code shows the integration: add to store, update indices and entropy, do a localized
contradiction check (by gathering related events via indices), then retrieve related events for context (using
a function that queries by overlapping fields or similarity). Each of those sub-calls
19
system might either treat each image as opaque (thus possibly high entropy always) or ignore them. This is
a known complexity but also a big opportunity, since many real-world agents will have non-text inputs. The
entropic associative memory research suggests storing images and multimodal data is feasible with an
entropy model , so we can take cues from there in future expansions.
Robustness to Faulty Data: Another blind spot is how errors in input data affect the system. If sensors give
a burst of nonsense (e.g., due to a malfunction), the memory might store some garbage events. These
could look high entropy and the system might erroneously preserve them, or they could cause
contradictions. We might need a sanity-check layer on inputs (like filtering extremely improbable events or
marking them as suspect). The design didn’t explicitly mention this kind of validation. Realistically, an
engineering solution often includes input validation to avoid polluting the knowledge base. This could be
integrated as a pre-processing step (e.g., don’t record an event that violates basic physical constraints
unless multiple sensors agree, etc.). Without it, the system’s memory could be thrown off by a single glitch
(like a sensor reading “temperature 1000°C” once).
User Control and Configurability: From an engineering perspective, we want to allow configuration of the
memory system depending on use-case. Some might want a very forgetful system (for privacy or
compliance), others want maximum retention. Our design is flexible enough to tune (by adjusting pruning
thresholds, etc.) but we haven’t explicitly enumerated those knobs. It’s more of a documentation issue, but
an opportunity is to clearly expose parameters such as: - Max memory size or age, - Entropy threshold, - List
of rules for contradiction (which could be customizable per deployment), - Fields included in EchoForm
(extensible schema), - etc. Documenting and providing these hooks increases the system’s practical
adaptability. Without them, one might have to dive into code to change behavior, which is less ideal.
In conclusion, while Kimera SWM provides a strong framework, these blind spots and considerations
remind us that: - We should be prepared to iterate on the semantic schema and incorporate flexibility. - We
should consider multi-layer memory for better performance. - We need to guard against over-pruning or
mis-prioritizing due to blind application of entropy metrics. - Additional modules (like inference or learning
components) could be integrated for a more complete cognitive system, if aligned with testability. - Practical
issues like debugging, error-handling, and configurability are as important as the core logic.
Addressing these in future versions can turn potential weaknesses into strengths. Many of these points lead
naturally into future development scenarios, which we will explore next, particularly focusing on expanding
the system’s scope and adapting it to other contexts like multimodal data and edge devices.
Future Development Scenarios
Looking ahead, the Kimera SWM system can be extended and applied in numerous ways. In this section, we
outline several future development scenarios that build on the current design while staying within the
realm of engineering feasibility. These include handling multiple data modalities with entropy scaling,
enabling more autonomous semantic adaptation of the system, and deploying the system in resource-
constrained edge AI environments.
Multimodal Entropy Scaling: Thus far, we have primarily discussed semantic memory in terms of textual or
symbolic information (events described by words or categorical data). A clear next step is to incorporate
multimodal data – images, audio, sensor signals – into the working memory. Each event (scar) could
include not just symbolic fields but also references to raw data (e.g., an image from a camera at the time of
15
23
learning loop or just heuristic tweaking. The key is that the engine doesn’t need to be static; it can be made
to evaluate outcomes (did resolving contradiction this way avoid future issues?) and adjust. - Emergent
Semantic Relationships: As the memory grows, new connections between concepts may emerge. The
system might autonomously form what in knowledge representation would be called ontologies or semantic
networks. For instance, it might notice that every time event type = “delivery” occurs, there’s also an event
“feedback received” after – forming a causal rule. It could then add that rule to its knowledge (somewhere
between memory and inference). This is stepping into the territory of knowledge discovery. While not
originally in scope, a semantic working memory with an entropy focus might naturally highlight such
patterns (because if two events are always paired, treating them as one higher-level event reduces entropy
significantly). The future system could autonomously compress those into a single composite event type or
a rule that binds them. This is an opportunity for building more abstract knowledge out of raw episodic
data.
All these adaptations should be done within “strict engineering realism,” meaning we’d implement them as
incremental improvements or use existing machine learning techniques, not magic. For example, using
clustering or pattern mining algorithms on the event log to propose schema changes is feasible. Testing
different pruning thresholds and measuring query success is feasible.
Edge-AI Deployment: One of the envisioned scenarios is deploying Kimera SWM on edge devices – devices
with limited compute, memory, and no constant cloud connectivity (e.g., a home robot, an IoT hub, a smart
vehicle). This imposes certain constraints and opens opportunities: - Lightweight Footprint: We must
ensure our implementation is lightweight in terms of memory overhead (both in memory stored and code).
That’s why the design eschews heavy frameworks. We might implement it in C++ for efficiency. Also, an
edge device might only have storage for, say, a few thousand events, meaning the entropy-guided pruning
is not just a luxury but a necessity. We might integrate with flash storage for archival, as edge devices often
can dump old data to an SD card or similar. - Intermittent Processing: Edge devices often can’t do heavy
processing continuously (battery life, etc.). Kimera SWM might therefore operate in bursts – e.g., do pruning
or entropy recomputation during idle times or when connected to power. This requires scheduling and
perhaps a notion of degrade mode: if the device is busy doing real-time tasks, the memory management
might defer operations (which is okay for a while but not indefinitely). Building in those considerations (like
thread priorities or external triggers such as “power plugged in, run maintenance”) would be practical. -
Privacy and On-Device Learning: Using SWM on edge means data (events about a user or environment)
can be retained and processed locally without uploading to cloud, preserving privacy. This is a big selling
point. Our approach is well-suited since it doesn’t assume cloud connectivity at all. A future scenario could
be personal assistants that keep a long-term memory of user interactions on-device. The SWM could ensure
it remembers important preferences (high entropy events like unique user feedback) while trimming
routine interactions. If the device runs low on space, it prunes using our strategies, ideally not losing
anything critical. Because it’s entropy-driven, one could argue it prunes in a way that minimizes loss of useful
info, which is what you want on an edge device with limited capacity. - Integration with Edge AI Models:
Many edge scenarios involve smaller neural networks or rule-based systems doing tasks. Kimera SWM
could serve as a knowledge cache for those. For example, a small speech recognizer runs on device
producing transcripts (events), and SWM stores what’s said and relevant context. Later, when the device
needs to respond or make a decision, it queries SWM for context (like “did the user mention this appliance
recently?”). This can make even a small model seem more intelligent because it has memory. Future
development might involve providing a simple API for local AI modules to store and retrieve events from
SWM. The opportunity here is to become a sort of middleware for memory in edge AI deployments. -
Resilience: Edge devices might face power loss or reboots, so SWM should be resilient – regularly
25
have presented a system design that is both conceptually innovative and grounded in practical engineering
feasibility. Key contributions of the design include:
Event-Centric Memory Units: By introducing scars as structured event records encoded in the
EchoForm grammar, we ensure that memory is stored at a meaningful granularity. This allows the
system to recall and reason about past episodes in a way that mirrors human episodic memory and
aligns with cognitive theories where events form the basis of recall . It also standardizes memory
storage, aiding consistency and comparison across events.
Entropy-Guided Memory Management: We applied the concept of entropy to measure and control
the information content of the working memory. This led to mechanisms for pruning and
compression that eliminate low-value data (analogous to removing low-entropy, uninformative parts
of a model ) and preserve high-value content (ensuring mutual information is retained in the
knowledge base ). The entropy tension field concept further provides a dynamic equilibrium
model, whereby the system self-balances between order and disorder, preventing both chaotic
overload and oversimplified forgetting.
Consistency Preservation via Contradiction Engine: Recognizing that any persistent memory
must deal with accumulating inconsistencies, we included a contradiction detection and resolution
module. Inspired by approaches like the Aletheion Agent’s recursive consistency checks , our
contradiction engine ensures that the set of stored beliefs/events remains largely self-consistent or
at least flags uncertainties clearly. This is crucial for reliability – an AI that contradicts itself is not
trustworthy. By catching contradictions, we either resolve them or isolate them, maintaining the
overall structural integrity of the agent’s knowledge.
Non-Tokenized, Contextual Recall: Memory retrieval in Kimera SWM operates on a semantic,
context-driven basis. This not only makes recall more flexible and robust to wording changes but
also dovetails with the idea that memory should be accessed when contextually relevant (much like
cue-based recall in humans ). By avoiding dependence on exact token matches, we increase the
chance the system finds relevant past knowledge whenever it’s needed, and does so efficiently
through structured indices.
Realizability and Efficiency: Throughout the paper, we addressed how each component can be
implemented with existing data structures and algorithms, from hash maps to priority queues. We
discussed computational overheads and ways to mitigate them (like incremental entropy updates
and background pruning tasks). This shows that Kimera SWM is not just a theoretical concept; it’s an
engineering blueprint that could be coded and run on current hardware. Moreover, aligning with
Landauer’s principle and related physical insights has an added benefit: it implicitly guides us to
designs that are energy-efficient – a trait desirable in any modern computing system, especially for
edge devices.
Adaptability and Future-Proofing: We also critically examined the design for blind spots and
highlighted future improvements, such as hierarchical memory layers and multimodal integration.
This forward-looking analysis ensures that the core design is not a dead-end but rather a foundation
that can evolve. In particular, the capacity to incorporate multimodal data and to self-optimize
memory retention policies will make Kimera SWM applicable to a wide range of AI systems, from
personal assistants to autonomous drones.

index[field].setdefault(val, set()).add(event_id)
C. Pruning Algorithm Outline
function prune_memory(target_size):
compute entropy_score[e] for each event e in memory_store:
entropy_score = h(e) (as defined above)
influence_score = number of events depending on e (links or queries)
combined_score = f(entropy_score, influence_score, age(e))
# e.g., could be entropy_score + λ * (1/(1+influence_score)) - μ *
age_weight
sort events by combined_score ascending
while memory_store.size > target_size:
candidate = next event in sorted list
if influence_score(candidate) > threshold:
continue # skip crucial events
remove candidate from memory_store
for field in index:
remove candidate.id from index[field] lists
mark candidate as pruned (move to archive if needed)
Tuning parameters: - λ could weight influence (to heavily penalize pruning of influential events). - μ
could incorporate age (so older events get slightly lower score, hence more likely to prune if not otherwise
important).
D. Contradiction Check Examples
State conflict rule (in pseudo-code):
def check_state_conflict(event):
# If event has a state field (or action implies a state change)
state_info = extract_state(event) # e.g., ("deviceX","ON")
if state_info:
entity, state = state_info
if entity in state_index: # state_index could track last known
state
last_state, last_time = state_index[entity]
if last_state != state and events_overlap(last_time,
event["time"]):
flag_contradiction(entity, last_state, state, event["id"])
•
30
# Update state_index
state_index[entity] = (state, event["time"])
Causal loop check:
def check_causal_loop(event):
# simple detection: if an event indirectly causes itself
seen = set()
def dfs(eid):
if eid in seen:
return True # loop found
seen.add(eid)
for out in causal_links.get(eid, []):
if dfs(out):
return True
return False
if dfs(event["id"]):
flag_contradiction("causalloop", event["id"])
E. Memory Recall Trigger (Cue Match Pseudo-code)
def recall_by_context(current_event):
# Use partial match: find events sharing actor or location
related = set()
for field in ["actors","location","action"]:
if field in current_event:
val = current_event[field]
if isinstance(val, list):
for v in val:
related |= index[field].get(v, set())
else:
related |= index[field].get(val, set())
# Filter by time or other context if needed
recalls = []
for eid in related:
e = memory_store[eid]
# maybe ensure it's not too old or too general
if similarity(e, current_event) > SIM_THRESHOLD:
recalls.append(e)
return sorted(recalls, key=lambda e: similarity(e, current_event),
reverse=True)[:5]
Where similarity(e, current_event) could be a simple count of matching fields or a learned
function.

F. Performance Considerations:
With N events in memory, typical operations complexities:
Adding an event: O(number of indexed fields) ~ O(F).
Removing an event: O(F).
Query by exact match on one field: O(results) (due to direct index hit).
Query by two fields: O(min(results_field1, results_field2)) for intersection.
Entropy update: O(1) per event add/remove per distribution tracked.
Pruning cycle: O(N log N) for sorting scores, but N is limited by design.
Contradiction check on insert: O(k) with k related events, usually much smaller than N.
Memory overhead: indices roughly use memory proportional to N * F (but each just storing IDs,
possibly much smaller than events themselves). This is manageable if F is moderate (tens of fields).
If N gets large (which we try to avoid via pruning), we might consider external storage for older
events or a more scalable database, but then we depart from fully self-contained. Our assumption is
that by the time N threatens system limits, pruning will have kicked in.
G. Verification and Testing:
During implementation, one should test components in isolation: - Generate synthetic events with known
patterns to verify entropy calculations (e.g., 50% of events one type, 50% another => entropy ~1 bit). - Test
pruning logic by injecting dummy events and seeing if low entropy ones get removed and critical ones stay.
- Simulate a contradiction (like add two opposing events) and ensure the engine flags it. - Simulate a recall
scenario: given an event, pre-fill memory with one clearly related and one unrelated event, see if
recall_by_context returns the related one.
By approaching testing in this controlled manner, we ensure each piece behaves as expected before
integrating into an agent.

the informational energy they steward. We anticipate that future iterations and implementations will further
