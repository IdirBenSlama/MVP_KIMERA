### Performance Anomalies and Observations

1. **GPU Utilization Anomaly**: GPU usage peaks at 64% with 4 threads but drops to 20% with 8 threads, suggesting potential scheduling or batching inefficiencies.

2. **Throughput Spike**: The dramatic increase from 3.97 ops/s (2 threads) to 31.62 ops/s (4 threads) indicates optimal parallelization at the 4-thread level.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: The system demonstrates exceptional memory management with only 1.1% increase in system memory usage despite handling 64x more features.

### Recommendations

#### 1. **Production Configuration**
- **Optimal**: 4-16 threads for best throughput/latency balance
- **High-Load**: Up to 64 threads for acceptable performance
- **Maximum**: 128 threads only for stress testing or specific use cases

#### 2. **GPU Optimization**
- Investigate GPU scheduling at higher thread counts
- Consider dynamic batching strategies to improve GPU utilization
