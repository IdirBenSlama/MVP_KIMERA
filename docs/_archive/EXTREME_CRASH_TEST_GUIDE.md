# EXTREME TYRANNIC CRASH TEST GUIDE
## Kimera SWM Alpha Prototype V0.1

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
This extreme crash test suite is designed to intentionally break the system. It will:
- Consume massive amounts of memory
- Create zombie threads
- Inject artificial failures
- Cause timeouts and deadlocks
- Potentially crash the entire application

**DO NOT RUN IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**

### Purpose

The Extreme Tyrannic Crash Test goes beyond traditional load testing to identify:
1. **Absolute Breaking Points** - Where and how the system fails catastrophically
2. **Failure Cascades** - How failures propagate through the system
3. **Recovery Capabilities** - Whether the system can recover from extreme conditions
4. **Resource Leaks** - Memory, thread, and GPU resource management under stress
5. **Edge Cases** - Unusual failure modes that only appear under extreme conditions

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. MEMORY APOCALYPSE
- **Threads**: 256
- **Features**: 4096

#### 2. THREAD STORM
- **Threads**: 1024
- **Features**: 512
- **Burst Mode**: Enabled (10x sudden spikes)
- **Purpose**: Test thread scheduling and context switching limits
- **Expected Failures**: Thread creation failures, scheduler overload

- **Depth**: 100
- **Purpose**: Test stack depth limits and recursive processing
- **Expected Failures**: Stack overflow, recursive timeout

#### 4. CHAOS MONKEY UNLEASHED
- **Chaos Probability**: 90%
- **Exception Rate**: 50%
- **Infinite Loop Probability**: 30%
- **Purpose**: Test system resilience to random failures
- **Expected Failures**: Cascading failures, corrupted state

#### 5. ENDURANCE MARATHON
- **Threads**: 512
- **Features**: 2048
- **Timeout**: 120s
- **Purpose**: Test long-running stability and resource leaks
- **Expected Failures**: Gradual degradation, memory leaks

### Chaos Injection Mechanisms

#### 1. Memory Pressure
```python
# Allocates specified percentage of available memory
memory_pressure=80.0  # Uses 80% of available RAM
```

#### 2. CPU Affinity Chaos
```python
# Randomly restricts threads to CPU cores
cpu_affinity_chaos=True
```

#### 3. Infinite Loop Injection
```python
# Creates zombie threads with controlled infinite loops
infinite_loop_probability=0.3  # 30% chance
```

#### 4. Exception Bombs
```python
# Randomly throws exceptions during processing
exception_injection_rate=0.5  # 50% of requests
```

#### 5. Network Latency Simulation
```python
# Adds artificial delays to simulate network issues
network_latency_ms=2000  # 2 second delays
```

### Metrics Collected

#### Failure Metrics
- **Timeout Failures**: Requests exceeding time limits
- **Memory Failures**: Out of memory errors
- **Exception Failures**: Caught exceptions with stack traces
- **Corrupted Responses**: Invalid or incomplete responses
- **Cascade Failures**: When >50% of requests fail
- **Zombie Processes**: Threads that won't terminate

#### Performance Metrics
- **Response Times**: Min, Max, Avg, P95, P99
- **Throughput Degradation**: Ops/s under stress
- **Memory Peaks**: Maximum memory usage
- **GPU Utilization**: Peak and average GPU usage
- **Recovery Time**: Time to return to baseline after stress

#### System State Metrics
- **Thread Count**: Active, zombie, and total threads
- **Memory Bombs**: Allocated memory blocks
- **File Descriptors**: Open handles (if applicable)
- **CPU Core Usage**: Per-core utilization

### Running the Tests

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have sufficient system resources
# Recommended: 32GB RAM, 8+ CPU cores, GPU with 16GB+ VRAM

# Install monitoring tools
pip install psutil numpy

# Set system limits (Linux/Mac)
ulimit -n 10000  # Increase file descriptor limit
ulimit -s unlimited  # Increase stack size
```

#### Execution
```bash
# Run the extreme crash test
python tests/extreme_tyrannic_crash_test.py

# Monitor system resources in another terminal
watch -n 1 'free -h; nvidia-smi'
```

#### Safety Measures
1. **Save all work** before running tests
2. **Close unnecessary applications**
3. **Have system monitoring tools ready**
4. **Be prepared to force-kill the process**
5. **Run in isolated environment if possible**

### Interpreting Results

#### Success Criteria
- System survives without complete crash
- Graceful degradation under load
- Recovery after load reduction
- No permanent resource leaks

#### Failure Analysis
1. **Catastrophic Failure**: Complete system crash
   - Action: Implement circuit breakers
   
2. **Memory Exhaustion**: OOM killer activated
   - Action: Improve memory management
   
3. **Thread Explosion**: Too many threads created
   - Action: Implement thread pooling
   
4. **Cascade Failure**: Failures propagate
   - Action: Add isolation boundaries
   
5. **Zombie Apocalypse**: Unkillable processes
   - Action: Improve cleanup mechanisms

# Check for zombie processes
ps aux | grep defunct

# Monitor memory recovery
free -h
```

### Recommendations Based on Results

#### If Success Rate < 50%
- Reduce concurrent thread count
- Implement request queuing
- Add circuit breakers

#### If Memory Failures > 10%
- Implement memory pooling
- Add garbage collection triggers
- Reduce payload sizes

#### If Cascade Failures > 0
- Add bulkheads between components
- Implement retry with backoff
- Add health checks

#### If Zombie Threads > 0
- Improve thread lifecycle management
- Add timeout handlers
- Implement force cleanup

### Next Steps

1. **Analyze Failure Patterns**: Identify common failure modes
2. **Implement Safeguards**: Add protection against identified failures
3. **Create Chaos Engineering Pipeline**: Regular chaos testing
4. **Document Limits**: Clear documentation of system boundaries
5. **Build Recovery Procedures**: Automated recovery mechanisms

### Conclusion

The Extreme Tyrannic Crash Test provides invaluable insights into system behavior under catastrophic conditions. While the standard tests show excellent performance under normal and high loads, this extreme testing reveals:

- Hard limits that trigger system failure
- Failure propagation patterns
- Resource management weaknesses
- Recovery capabilities

Use these results to build a more resilient system that can handle not just expected loads, but also unexpected chaos and extreme conditions.
