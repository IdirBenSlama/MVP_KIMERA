## Usage Examples

### Basic Operations
```python
from backend.graph.models import create_geoid, get_geoid

# Create a geoid in the graph
create_geoid({
    "geoid_id": "CONCEPT_123",
    "semantic_state": {"meaning": 0.8, "clarity": 0.9},
    "symbolic_state": {"type": "concept", "domain": "test"}
})

# Retrieve from graph
geoid_data = get_geoid("CONCEPT_123")
```

### Health Monitoring
```python
from backend.graph.session import driver_liveness_check

# Check Neo4j connectivity
if driver_liveness_check():
    print("Neo4j is healthy")
else:
    print("Neo4j connection issues")
```

### Direct Queries
```python
from backend.graph.session import get_session

with get_session() as session:
    result = session.run("""
        MATCH (g:Geoid)-[:CAUSES]->(effect:Geoid)
        RETURN g.geoid_id, effect.geoid_id, count(*) as causal_links
    """)
    for record in result:
        print(f"Causal relationship: {record['g.geoid_id']} -> {record['effect.geoid_id']}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Refused
```
Solution: Ensure Neo4j is running and accessible
docker ps | grep neo4j
docker start kimera-neo4j
```

#### Import Errors
```
Solution: Verify Python path and package structure
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
```

#### Performance Issues
```
Solution: Check connection pool settings and query optimization
NEO4J_POOL_SIZE=50  # Increase pool size
```

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check Neo4j status
curl http://localhost:7474/db/data/

# Monitor system health
curl http://localhost:8000/system/health

# View Neo4j logs
docker logs kimera-neo4j
```
