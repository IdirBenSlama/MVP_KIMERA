# Requirements Consolidation Report

## Overview
Successfully consolidated multiple redundant requirements.txt files into a single, unified requirements file for the entire KIMERA SWM system.

## Files Removed
The following redundant requirements files have been removed:
- `requirements_clean.txt` - Duplicate with exact version pinning
- `requirements_financial.txt` - Financial-specific dependencies (moved to optional section)
- `requirements_original_backup.txt` - Backup file with many unused dependencies
- `requirements-minimal.txt` - Minimal version without proper version constraints
- `tests/requirements.txt` - Only contained numpy and scipy (already in main file)

## Single Requirements File
**Kept:** `requirements.txt` - The main, well-organized requirements file

## Enhancements Made
Added missing dependencies that were present in other files but needed for the system:
- `neo4j>=5.28.1,<6.0.0` - Graph database support
- `pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0,<1.0.0` - Async testing support
- `hvac>=2.3.0,<3.0.0` - HashiCorp Vault client
- `jsonschema>=4.23.0,<5.0.0` - JSON schema validation

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Dependency Management** - Single source of truth for all dependencies
2. **Reduced Confusion** - No more conflicting or duplicate requirements files
3. **Better Version Control** - Proper version ranges to avoid dependency conflicts
4. **Organized Structure** - Dependencies grouped by category with clear comments
5. **Optional Features** - Financial analysis dependencies marked as optional

## Installation
To install all dependencies for the KIMERA SWM system:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Financial Features
If you need financial analysis capabilities, uncomment the financial dependencies section in requirements.txt:
```bash
# pandas>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
# yfinance>=0.2.18,<0.3.0
# matplotlib>=3.7.0,<4.0.0
# seaborn>=0.12.0,<0.13.0
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the consolidated requirements file in a fresh environment
2. Update any documentation that references the old requirements files
3. Update CI/CD pipelines to use the single requirements.txt file
